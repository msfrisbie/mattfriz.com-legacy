  <h2 class="giants-orange">Trip Overview</h2>
  <p>This six-day trip will follow a loop through the Sierra Nevada range in western Ansel Adams Wilderness, cutting north to Lake 10005, and coming back around Post Peak. It kicks off from the Fernandez Trailhead, where we will hike northwest toward Monument Lake and then head north over Post Peak Pass to reach our destination at Lake 10005. After a layover day here, we will head east over Isberg Pass and cut south to stay at Joe Crane Lake before we hike back out near the Granite Creek campground. There will be plenty of opportunities for fishing, swimming, photography, and drinking in the spectacular scenery throughout the trip.</p>
  <p>This trip provides a great opportunity for backpackers to visit a spectacular lake near the remote southeastern boundary of Yosemite National Park. With its long sandy beach and extraordinary camping, Lake 10,005 is just one of hundreds of small lakes dotting the southern boundary of the park that are the headwaters of the mighty Merced River. We will spend a night at the lake and have ample time to explore any number of the nearby lakes and peaks. Our route to the lake will take us on trails originally blazed back in the late 19th century by the U.S. Army Cavalry as they patrolled and protected the park. Entering the wilderness from the less-traveled Granite Creek area of the Ansel Adams Wilderness, we will hike through sub-alpine forests of lodgepole pine, mountain hemlock, and red fir; beside meadows filled with wildflowers; and past numerous alpine lakes. Vast awe-inspiring views of the Sierra Nevada will reward us on each of two crossings of Yosemite National Park’s southern boundary at over 10,000 feet.</p>
  <p>If you are looking for a trip that is shorter than many of the seven- and nine-day High Sierra backpack trips, this trip will allow you to visit a remote area of southern Yosemite and also experience some of the best views to be found in the Sierra Nevada.</p>

  <p><strong>Pre-Trip: </strong>The group will meet at the Clover Meadow campground in the late afternoon, in order to have equipment checks, let the group members get to know each other, and meet the leaders and ask questions. We will shuttle half the group's vehicles to the exit point. A non-backcountry-style dinner will be provided by the leaders.</p>
  <p><strong>Day 1: </strong>The trip will begin with a short drive to the Fernandez Trailhead, where we will begin the day's hike. We will ingress northwest and camp at or near Monument Lake. Today, we will cover roughly 7 miles and ascend over 1,800 feet.</p>
  <p><strong>Day 2: </strong>From Monument Lake, we will continue north 5 miles and another 1,500 feet to Post Peak Pass. Descending from the pass, it is a short hike down to Lake 10005, where we will set up camp. Today, we will cover another 7 miles and will ascend 1,500 feet to the ridge before descending to the lake.</p>
  <p><strong>Day 3: </strong>This day is a layover day, we will leave our camp set up and spend the day enjoying the area. The surrounding terrain offers plenty of ways to spend the day, such as day hikes to Harriet Lake, climbing Isberg Peak, visiting the Merced River.</p>
  <p><strong>Day 4: </strong>We will break camp and head east towards Isberg Peak and continuing south toward Joe Crane Lake, where we will spend the night. Today we will cover about 7 miles and ascend 600 feet to the ridge before descending 1000 feet to the lake.</p>
  <p><strong>Day 5: </strong>This day is the long but easy hike out. We will be on trail the entire day as we head south past Knoblock Meadow and egress at the Granite Creek campground.

  <h2 class="giants-orange">Trip Overview</h2>
  <p>The section of the John Muir Trail, aka Pacific Crest Trail, leading through the southern part of Yosemite NP into the Ritter Range in the adjacent Ansel Adams Wilderness offers some of the most spectacular scenery within the High Sierra.  It is a unique combination of high canyons, sparkling lakes, and rugged mountain summits.</p>
  <p>Our journey starts in Tuolumne Meadows in Yosemite NP.  After gently ascending through the big meadows of Lyell Canyon, we top the High Sierra Crest at Donohue Pass.  Mt. Lyell, Banner Peak, and Mt. Ritter, all about 13,000 feet high, dominate the skyline. From the pass we descend, passing a series of large alpine lakes into the June Lake Recreation area, where our trek ends.</p>
  <p>In addition to spectacular scenery, this trip will provide an opportunity for novices as well as experienced backpackers to improve their current backpacking skills and to learn strategies for gear selection, menu planning, and food preparation.</p>

  <h2 class="giants-orange">Trip Itinerary</h2>
  <img class="pub-cover" src="http://content.sierraclub.org/outings/sites/content.sierraclub.org.outings/files/styles/trip-main/public/trips/main-images/15142a_header.jpg?itok=Y3uz7zym" />
  <p><strong>Day 1:</strong> We will meet in the afternoon on Tuesday, June 30, 2015 at a campground in the June Lake Recreation Area near Lee Vining in the Eastern Sierra (at approximately 7,500 feet elevation).  We will spend the rest of the day getting to know each other, organizing our gear, and splitting up the commissary equipment before we have dinner at the campground.</p>
  <p><strong>Day 2:</strong> We start our trip with a light breakfast at the campground and leave our cars at nearby Silver Lake. From there we ride the public YARTS bus to Tuolumne Meadows, where our hike begins. This first hiking day will be a gentle 500-foot ascent through the meadows of Lyell Canyon before we make camp along the shores of the Lyell Fork of the Tuolumne River. Total distance is about 8 miles.</p>
  <p><strong>Day 3:</strong> The terrain is getting steeper and more challenging as we climb more than 2,000 feet to cross the High Sierra at Donohue Pass (above 11,100 feet), which is flanked by mighty Mt. Lyell, the highest point within Yosemite NP.  We leave the park and enter Ansel Adams Wilderness, descending gradually to the base of the Ritter Range.  Depending on conditions and group progress, we might climb into the secluded Marie Lakes (at 10,800 feet elevation) and make camp there. Total distance is 8-10 miles, depending on where we camp.</p> 
  <p><strong>Day 4:</strong> From here on, it is mainly downhill. We follow roaring Rush Creek, which connects a series of large alpine lakes. After hiking 7-9 miles, depending on where we stay the night before, we reach our last camp at the shores of Gem Lake (at 9,000 feet elevation).</p>
  <p><strong>Day 5:</strong> A gradual 5-mile descent along Rush Creek brings us back to our cars at Silver Lake.</p>
  <p>The route and itinerary are a general plan and may need to be changed due to unforeseen conditions or circumstances. Snow conditions and runoff are always a big uncertainty on an early season trip. In addition, weather, progress of the group, campsite availability, and other factors may require the leaders to make adjustments. Participants need to be flexible.</p>
